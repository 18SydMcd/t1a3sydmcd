I have heard many people say that hot dogs are made of pig tongues, but they are actually made from pork, beef, or chicken. Personally I thought they were made out of some foreign animals tail... I think people should know what they are actually made of so they don'nt think they are eating some animals tongue or other strange parts.

<br> 
My opinion on brussel sprouts is very colourful. I do not like them and they ruin my day. But they are good for you so my mom makes me eat them. Don't tell her but I use to feed them to the dog. Brussel sprouts grow on stalks.

Honestly I made this about food because of how hungry I was. <img src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_pLgmbLjZhBw/TI66NSLYtmI/AAAAAAAAAb8/jny8qTgWHRs/s320/embarrassed+1.jpg>
